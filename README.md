How It Works

Data Inputs
The system processes 12 environmental features, including:
PM2.5: Fine particulate matter levels.
PM10: Coarse particulate matter levels.
NO: Nitric oxide concentration.
NO2: Nitrogen dioxide concentration.
NOx: Oxides of nitrogen concentration.
NH3: Ammonia concentration.
CO: Carbon monoxide concentration.
SO2: Sulfur dioxide concentration.
O3: Ozone concentration.
Benzene: Benzene levels in the air.
Toluene: Toluene levels in the air.
Xylene: Xylene levels in the air.
AQI: Air Quality Index (target variable).

These pollutants, along with other data points like location and time, feed into our machine learning model for accurate AQI predictions.

redictive Model
Our model uses deep neural networks and regression algorithms to learn complex patterns from the data. By analyzing historical pollution data, the model predicts future AQI values, enabling proactive decision-making to improve air quality.

Real-Time Updates
By continuously integrating new environmental data, the system provides up-to-the-minute air quality updates, helping authorities respond to sudden pollution spikes or changes in air quality.

Use Cases

- Urban Air Quality Monitoring: Track and manage air quality in cities, identify pollution hotspots, and make informed decisions on urban planning.
- Industrial Compliance: Monitor industrial emissions in real-time and ensure compliance with environmental regulations.
- Public Health & Safety: Provide actionable air quality data to health organizations to prevent pollution-related health risks.
- Smart Cities: Integrate with IoT devices and city infrastructures to create intelligent solutions for urban air quality management.

Future Enhancements

- Pollution Source Tracking: Implement algorithms to track and identify the source of pollution, whether from traffic, factories, or other sources.
- Citizen Reporting Integration: Allow citizens to report local pollution levels, integrating crowdsourced data for more accurate forecasting.
- Weather Integration: Integrate real-time weather data to enhance the prediction model, considering how weather patterns influence air quality.
